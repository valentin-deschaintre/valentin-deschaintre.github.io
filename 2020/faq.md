<p>Yes! We are planning on a full EGSR 2020 program, including research and industry papers as well as keynotes.</p>

<p><i><b>Q: </b>Will the submission deadline be extended because of COVID-19?</i></p>

<p>Due to the developing COVID-19 situation, we have pushed back the research papers abstract deadline to Monday April 13 and the paper submission deadline to April 17.</p>

<p><i><b>Q: </b>Will there be support for remote presentation of papers?</i></p>

<p>All accepted papers must have at least one author registered for the conference to present the paper. We will provide a mechanism for remote presentation of the talk.</p>

<p>This year’s EGSR will take place completely virtually. We are currently evaluating available options for remote attendance and the format and details for this are still being worked out.
