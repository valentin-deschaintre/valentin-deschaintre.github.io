<p><i>Due to the developing COVID-19 situation, we have pushed back the research papers abstract deadline to Monday April 13 and the paper submission deadline to April 17.<br>
Furthermore, this year’s EGSR will take place completely virtually. We are currently evaluating available options for remote attendance and the format and details for this are still being worked out. Authors of accepted papers this year will be asked to present their work remotely. We encourage authors to submit work to EGSR despite the altered circumstances of a virtual EGSR meeting.</i></p>
Please see the <a href="/faq">EGSR 2020 FAQ</a> for more information about COVID-19 and changes to the conference this year.

 The 31st edition of Eurographics Symposium on Rendering will be held virtually from June 30th to July 3rd, 2020. EGSR 2020 is being jointly organized by the <a href='https://wp.doc.ic.ac.uk/rgi/'>Realistic Graphics and Imaging group</a> at Imperial College and the <a href='http://vecg.cs.ucl.ac.uk/'>Virtual Environments and Computer Graphics group</a> at University College London (UCL).
