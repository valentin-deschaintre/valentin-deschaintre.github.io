To emulate the random encounters and interactions which make up the true spice of in person conferences, we offer two sessions of social mixers.
One from 12:00 to 12:45 UTC on Wednesday 1st of July and one from 16:45 to 17:30 UTC on Thursday 2nd of July.

To participate you need to register on this form: <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd_eRP4zYosko1O6WMDhRpVPkx2YLvQV7i_ogUoKMc6qh9nDg/viewform">*here*</a>.

Each session will consist in the creation of small random groups of registered people with a mix of senior and junior people in each group. 
You will be invited at the beginning of this event in a private chat on Rocket Chat alongside the other people of your group. From there you can call the group using the call button on the top of the window!
