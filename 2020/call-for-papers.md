title: Call for Papers to EGSR 2020
excerpt: "Submit your work to EGSR 2020"
year: 2020
---

<p>This year, EGSR features two paper submission tracks: the <a href="#research">Research Track</a> and the  <a href="#industry">Industry Track</a> (new as of last year).</p>

<p><i>The developing COVID-19 situation makes it unlikely that EGSR is going to take place as usual. We are currently evaluating available options for remote attendance. At any rate, authors of accepted papers this year are not required to present their work in person and may elect to present remotely instead. We encourage authors to submit work to EGSR even if they do not think they will be able or willing to attend in person due to the virus situation and/or travel restrictions that may be in place at the time.</i></p>

<h1 id="research"><strong>Research Track</strong></h1>
<p>A PDF version of Research Track call for papers is available to download from <a href="research.pdf">here</a>.</p>
<p>The Eurographics Symposium on Rendering 2020 will take place in London, England from June 30th to July 2nd, 2020. This 31th event continues the series of highly successful Eurographics Symposia and Workshops on Rendering.</p>
<p>All accepted research papers will be presented at EGSR 2020 and archived in the <a href="https://diglib.eg.org/">Eurographics digital library</a> (exact publication modalities pending). Furthermore, a selection of them will be published in an issue of the <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/14678659">Computer Graphics Forum</a> (CGF) journal, based on both the recommendations of the reviewers and the outcome of a second cycle of review.</p>
<p>We are looking for work that shapes the future of rendering in computer graphics and related fields, such as virtual and augmented reality, deep learning, and computational photography.</p>
<p>There is no fixed minimum or maximum paper length. However, submissions over 12 pages in length will be treated as exceptional cases, and length must be proportional to contribution.</p>
<p>For each submitted paper, a minimum of 3 reviews will be provided to the authors, who will then be able to provide a rebuttal to clarify misunderstandings and answer the reviewers’ questions. The reviewers will then discuss and decide on the acceptance of the paper to the EGSR 2020 program. In the event of acceptance, the authors will submit a revised version of their manuscript prior to the conference.</p>
<h3><strong>Topics of interest</strong></h3>

<h1 id="industry"><strong>Industry Track call for papers</strong></h1>
<p>A PDF version of Industry Track call for paper is available to download from <a href="industry.pdf">here</a>.</p>
<p>The Eurographics Symposium on Rendering (EGSR) 2020 includes an Industry Track that includes invited papers from our colleagues in industry that are on topics of interest to the general rendering community. The goal of this track is to provide an accessible venue for getting out ideas that have found practical use in industry and could impact the future of rendering research, but that do not meet the standards of scientific evaluation expected in formal research papers. These papers will be curated by the papers co-chairs and will be presented in the conference along with the traditional research papers.</p>
<p>We are looking for papers that present ideas and applications of rendering (both high-end and real-time), as well as other aspects of image synthesis (e.g., image-based rendering, rendering for AR/VR, machine learning for rendering, etc.). Topics for possible Industry Track papers could include, but are not limited to:</p>
<ul><li>Novel rendering ideas that are interesting but might not be developed to the point of a formal research paper but are already successfully used in practice</li>
<li>Extensions or twists on existing rendering algorithms that have been found to produce better results</li>
<li>A description of a state-of-the-art rendering pipeline or rendering software system</li>
<li>The publication of a new dataset that would facilitate research in rendering</li>
<li>Position papers that pose interesting problems found in industry rendering applications that should be more emphasized in academic research</li></ul>
<p>Papers accepted in this new Industry Track will be published in the Eurographics Digital Library for archival purposes and presented at EGSR 2020, which will take place in London, England from June 30th to July 2nd, 2020.</p>
<h3><strong>How to Submit Your Work</strong></h3>
<p>Please email the program chairs at chairs-egsr2020@eg.org with a PDF of your paper submission with the subject “Industry Track Submission” by the deadline below. The chairs will then curate the industry track program from the submitted papers and provide feedback to the authors. We expect that most papers will be fairly short (around 1-4 pages) although authors can submit longer ones if necessary to describe their idea. The authors should use the “Industry Track” template available following <a href="../EGSR2020_Industry-Track_Template.zip">this link</a>.</p>
<h3><strong>Important dates (All times are midnight, 23:59 UTC)</strong></h3>
<ul><li>Industry Track papers deadline: May 26, 2020</li>
<li>Author notification: June 2, 2020</li>
<li>Final papers due: June 22, 2020</li></ul>

<h3><strong>Industry Track FAQ</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> Can people in academia submit?</p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> Yes, but we are looking for ideas that have shown practical use through some kind of industrial deployment.</p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> Should I submit to this track or to the standard research paper track?</p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> This track is designed to provide a low-overhead venue to get out ideas that have practical use but have not gone through the same scientific evaluation as a research paper. However, authors who feel that their idea would be a significant contribution to rendering community and are willing to meet the standards of evaluation and comparison to previous work of a research paper should strongly consider submitting a standard research paper.</p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> Can I submit a one-page paper?</p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> Yes.</p>
<p><strong>Q:</strong> Can a paper contain images from copyrighted material?</p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> We expect the submissions to be as close as possible to the final version which would appear in the Eurographics Digital Library. Please clear all the material contained in the paper with the appropriate owners of the IP to ensure it can be published prior to submission.</p>
