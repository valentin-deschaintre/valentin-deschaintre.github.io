# EGSR Website

This website was developped for the EGSR 2020 edition, which happened virtually from June 30th to July 3rd 2020. 
It has been adapted for the EGSR 2021 edition. All year specific data has been separated and the template and repository should be re-usable for future versions.

It is based on a fork of the CVMP website (https://github.com/cvmp/cvmp.github.io) and adapted to suit the online format.
