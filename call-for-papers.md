For over a decade, CVMP has built a reputation as the prime venue for researchers to meet with practitioners in the Creative Industries: film, broadcast, games. The Conference brings together expertise in video processing, computer vision, computer graphics, animation and physical simulation. It provides a forum for presentation of the latest research and application advances, combined with keynote and invited talks on state-of-the-art industry practice. CVMP regularly attracts around 140 attendees approximately 50:50 from academia and the creative industries. For the first time, CVMP is now an ACM SIGGRAPH sponsored event.

**Full Papers:**
We invite submissions of regular, technical papers presenting novel research or applications related to any aspect of media production. We particularly encourage submission of early stage doctoral work. Full length submitted papers should be no more than 10 pages and will be subject to double-blind peer review. Accepted papers will be presented in either oral or poster form, and will appear in the ACM Digital Library. Browse past CVMP papers in the ACM Digital Library here: <http://bit.ly/ACM_CVMP>
 
**Short Papers:**
submissions are invited in the form of a one-page extended abstract, describing innovative industry practice or academic research. Short papers will be presented in poster form at the conference, and will not appear in the ACM Digital Library. They can also describe work in progress and do not prevent submission of the work elsewhere.
 
**Demos:**
The demos programme promotes applied research and applications to facilitate collaborations between industrial and academic members of the media production community. Demos do not have to be related to full or short papers accepted at CVMP but should have the form of live demonstrations of media production methods and/or its applications. A one-page paper should be submitted describing the content of the demonstration and an overview of the approach.
 
**Industry Talks:**
This year we are pleased to introduce a new track for industry talks. These should be submitted in the form of a one-page extended abstract describing the proposed talk. Talks will take a similar form to submissions for talk at SIGGRAPH and FMX and can be talks that have already been presented at other venues.
