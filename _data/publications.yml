  abstract: 'Decomposing 3D assets into material parts is a common task for artists and creators, yet remains a highly manual process. In this work, we introduce Select Any Material (SAMa), a material selection approach for various 3D representations. Building on the recently introduced SAM2 video selection model, we extend its capabilities to the material domain. We leverage the model s cross-view consistency to create a 3D-consistent intermediate material-similarity representation in the form of a point cloud from a sparse set of views. Nearest-neighbor lookups in this similarity cloud allow us to efficiently reconstruct accurate continuous selection masks over objects surfaces that can be inspected from any view. Our method is multiview-consistent by design, alleviating the need for contrastive learning or feature-field pre-processing, and performs optimization-free selection in seconds. Our approach works on arbitrary 3D representations and outperforms several strong baselines in terms of selection accuracy and multiview consistency. It enables several compelling applications, such as replacing the diffuse-textured materials on a text-to-3D output with PBR materials, or selecting and editing materials on NeRFs and 3D-Gaussians.'

  abstract: 'High-quality material generation is key for virtual environment authoring and inverse rendering. We propose MaterialPicker, a multi-modal material generator leveraging a Diffusion Transformer (DiT) architecture, improving and simplifying the creation of high-quality materials from text prompts and/or photographs. Our method can generate a material based on an image crop of a material sample, even if the captured surface is distorted, viewed at an angle or partially occluded, as is often the case in photographs of natural scenes. We further allow the user to specify a text prompt to provide additional guidance for the generation. We finetune a pre-trained DiT-based video generator into a material generator, where each material map is treated as a frame in a video sequence. We evaluate our approach both quantitatively and qualitatively and show that it enables more diverse material generation and better distortion correction than previous work.'

  abstract: 'Modern 3D content creation heavily relies on procedural assets. In particular, procedural materials are ubiquitous in the industry, but their manipulation remains challenging. Previous work conditionally generates procedural graphs that match a given input image. However, the parameter generation step limits how accurately the generated graph matches the input image, due to a reliance on supervision with scarcely available procedural data. We propose to improve parameter prediction accuracy for image-conditioned procedural material generation by leveraging reinforcement learning (RL) and present the first RL approach for procedural materials. RL circumvents the limited availability of procedural data, the domain gap between real and synthetic materials, and the need for end-to-end differentiable loss functions. Given a target image, we retrieve a procedural material and use an RL-trained transformer model to predict a set of parameters that reconstruct the target image as closely as possible. We show that using RL significantly improves parameter prediction to match a given target image compared to supervised methods on both synthetic and real target images.'

  abstract: 'Procedural Implicit surfaces are a popular representation for shape modeling. They provide a simple framework for complex geometric operations such as Booleans, blending and deformations. However, their editability remains a challenging task: as the definition of the shape is purely implicit, direct manipulation of the shape cannot be performed. Thus, parameters of the model are often exposed through abstract sliders, which have to be non-trivially created by the user and understood by others for each individual model to modify. Further, each of these sliders needs to be set one by one to achieve the desired appearance. To circumvent this laborious process while preserving editability, we propose to directly manipulate the implicit surface in the viewport. We let the user naturally interact with the output shape, leveraging points on a co-parameterization we design specifically for implicit surfaces, to guide the parameter updates and reach the desired appearance faster. We leverage our automatic differentiation of the procedural implicit surface to propagate interactions made by the user in the viewport to the shape parameters themselves. We further design a solver that uses such information to guide an intuitive and smooth user workflow. We demonstrate different editing processes across multiple implicit shapes and parameters that would be tedious by tuning sliders.'

  abstract: 'Generative models have enabled intuitive image creation and manipulation using natural language. In particular, diffusion models have recently shown remarkable results for natural image editing. In this work, we propose to apply diffusion techniques to edit textures, a specific class of images that are an essential part of 3D content creation pipelines. We analyze existing editing methods and show that they are not directly applicable to textures, since their common underlying approach, manipulating attention maps, is unsuitable for the texture domain. To address this, we propose a novel approach that instead manipulates CLIP image embeddings to condition the diffusion generation. We define editing directions using simple text prompts (e.g., "aged wood" to "new wood") and map these to CLIP image embedding space using a texture prior, with a sampling-based approach that gives us identity-preserving directions in CLIP space. To further improve identity preservation, we project these directions to a CLIP subspace that minimizes identity variations resulting from entangled texture attributes. Our editing pipeline facilitates the creation of arbitrary sliders using natural language prompts only, with no ground-truth annotated data necessary.'

  abstract: "The three areas of realistic forward rendering, per-pixel inverse rendering, and generative image synthesis may seem like separate and unrelated sub-fields of graphics and vision. However, recent work has demonstrated improved estimation of per-pixel intrinsic channels (albedo, roughness, metallicity) based on a diffusion architecture; we call this the RGB→X problem. We further show that the reverse problem of synthesizing realistic images given intrinsic channels, X→RGB, can also be addressed in a diffusion framework. Focusing on the image domain of interior scenes, we introduce an improved diffusion model for RGB→X, which also estimates lighting, as well as the first diffusion X→RGB model capable of synthesizing realistic images from (full or partial) intrinsic channels. Our X→RGB model explores a middle ground between traditional rendering and generative models: we can specify only certain appearance properties that should be followed, and give freedom to the model to hallucinate a plausible version of the rest. This flexibility makes it possible to use a mix of heterogeneous training datasets, which differ in the available channels. We use multiple existing datasets and extend them with our own synthetic and real data, resulting in a model capable of extracting scene properties better than previous work and of generating highly realistic images of interior scenes."

  abstract: "We propose MeshLRM, a novel LRM-based approach that can reconstruct a high-quality mesh from merely four input images in less than one second. Different from previous large reconstruction models (LRMs) that focus on NeRF-based reconstruction, MeshLRM incorporates differentiable mesh extraction and rendering within the LRM framework. This allows for end-to-end mesh reconstruction by fine-tuning a pre-trained NeRF LRM with mesh rendering. Moreover, we improve the LRM architecture by simplifying several complex designs in previous LRMs. MeshLRM's NeRF initialization is sequentially trained with low- and high-resolution images; this new LRM training strategy enables significantly faster convergence and thereby leads to better quality with less compute. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art mesh reconstruction from sparse-view inputs and also allows for many downstream applications, including text-to-3D and single-image-to-3D generation."

  abstract: "We present MatAtlas, a method for consistent text-guided 3D model texturing. Following recent progress we leverage a large scale text-to-image generation model (e.g., Stable Diffusion) as a prior to texture a 3D model. We carefully design an RGB texturing pipeline that leverages a grid pattern diffusion, driven by depth and edges. By proposing a multi-step texture refinement process, we significantly improve the quality and 3D consistency of the texturing output. To further address the problem of baked-in lighting, we move beyond RGB colors and pursue assigning parametric materials to the assets. Given the high-quality initial RGB texture, we propose a novel material retrieval method capitalized on Large Language Models (LLM), enabling editabiliy and relightability. We evaluate our method on a wide variety of geometries and show that our method significantly outperform prior arts. We also analyze the role of each component through a detailed ablation study."

  abstract: "We introduce MatSynth, a dataset of 4,000+ CC0 ultra-high resolution PBR materials. Materials are crucial components of virtual relightable assets, defining the interaction of light at the surface of geometries. Given their importance, significant research effort was dedicated to their representation, creation and acquisition. However, in the past 6 years, most research in material acquisiton or generation relied either on the same unique dataset, or on company-owned huge library of procedural materials. With this dataset we propose a significantly larger, more diverse, and higher resolution set of materials than previously publicly available. We carefully discuss the data collection process and demonstrate the benefits of this dataset on material acquisition and generation applications. The complete data further contains metadata with each material's origin, license, category, tags, creation method and, when available, descriptions and physical size, as well as 3M+ renderings of the augmented materials, in 1K, under various environment lightings."

We present ControlMat, a method which, given a single photograph with uncontrolled illumination as input, conditions a diffusion model to generate plausible, tileable, high-resolution physically-based digital materials. We carefully analyze the behavior of diffusion models for multi-channel outputs, adapt the sampling process to fuse multi-scale information and introduce rolled diffusion to enable both tileability and patched diffusion for high-resolution outputs. Our generative approach further permits exploration of a variety of materials which could correspond to the input image, mitigating the unknown lighting conditions. We show that our approach outperforms recent inference and latent-space-optimization methods, and carefully validate our diffusion process design choices."

  abstract: "A 3D digital scene contains many components: lights, materials and geometries, interacting to reach the desired appearance. Staging such a scene is time-consuming and requires both artistic and technical skills. In this work, we propose PSDR-Room, a system allowing to optimize lighting as well as the pose and materials of individual objects to match a target image of a room scene, with minimal user input. To this end, we leverage a recent path-space differentiable rendering approach that provides unbiased gradients of the rendering with respect to geometry, lighting, and procedural materials, allowing us to optimize all of these components using gradient descent to visually match the input photo appearance. We use recent single-image scene understanding methods to initialize the optimization and search for appropriate 3D models and materials. We evaluate our method on real photographs of indoor scenes and demonstrate the editability of the resulting scene components."

- title: "Floaters No More: Radiance Field Gradient Scaling for Improved Near-Camera Training"
  authors: 
    - "Julien Philip"
    - "Valentin Deschaintre"
  abstract: "NeRF acquisition typically requires careful choice of near planes for the different cameras or suffers from background collapse, creating floating artifacts on the edges of the captured scene. The key insight of this work is that background collapse is caused by a higher density of samples in regions near cameras. As a result of this sampling imbalance, near-camera volumes receive significantly more gradients, leading to incorrect density buildup. We propose a gradient scaling approach to counter-balance this sampling imbalance, removing the need for near planes, while preventing background collapse. Our method can be implemented in a few lines, does not induce any significant overhead, and is compatible with most NeRF implementations."

  abstract: "Separating an image into meaningful underlying components is a crucial first step for both editing and understanding images. We present a method capable of selecting the regions of a photograph exhibiting the same material as an artist-chosen area. Our proposed approach is robust to shading, specular highlights, and cast shadows, enabling selection in real images. As we do not rely on semantic segmentation (different woods or metal should not be selected together), we formulate the problem as a similarity-based grouping problem based on a user-provided image location. In particular, we propose to leverage the unsupervised DINO features coupled with a proposed cross-similarity module and an MLP head to extract material similarities in an image. We train our model on a new synthetic image dataset, that we release. We show that our method generalizes well to real-world images. We carefully analyze our model's behavior on varying material properties and lighting. Additionally, we evaluate it against a hand-annotated benchmark of 50 real photographs. We further demonstrate our model on a set of applications, including material editing, in-video selection, and retrieval of object photographs with similar materials."

  abstract: "Node graph systems are used ubiquitously for material design in computer graphics. They allow the use of visual programming to achieve desired effects without writing code. As high-level design tools they provide convenience and flexibility, but mastering the creation of node graphs usually requires professional training. We propose an algorithm capable of generating multiple node graphs from different types of prompts, significantly lowering the bar for users to explore a specific design space. Previous work[Guererro22] was limited to unconditional generation of random node graphs, making the generation of an envisioned material challenging. We propose a multi-modal node graph generation neural architecture for high-quality procedural material synthesis which can be conditioned on different inputs (text or image prompts), using a CLIP-based encoder. We also create a substantially augmented material graph dataset, key to improving the generation quality. Finally, we generate high-quality graph samples using a regularized sampling process and improve the matching quality by differentiable optimization for top-ranked samples. We compare our methods to CLIP-based database search baselines (which are themselves novel) and achieve superior or similar performance without requiring massive data storage. We further show that our model can produce a set of material graphs unconditionally, conditioned on images, text prompts or partial graphs, serving as a tool for automatic visual programming completion.

  abstract: "We introduce text2fabric, a novel dataset that links free-text descriptions to various fabric materials. The dataset comprises 15,000 natural language descriptions associated to 3,000 corresponding images of fabric materials. Traditionally, material descriptions come in the form of tags/keywords, which limits their expressivity, induces pre-existing knowledge of the appropriate vocabulary, and ultimately leads to a chopped description system. Therefore, we study the use of free-text as a more appropriate way to describe material appearance, taking the use case of fabrics as a common item that non-experts may often deal with. Based on the analysis of the dataset, we identify a compact lexicon, set of attributes and key structure that emerge from the descriptions. This allows us to accurately understand how people describe fabrics and draw directions for generalization to other types of materials. We also show that our dataset enables specializing large vision-language models such as CLIP, creating a meaningful latent space for fabric appearance, and significantly improving applications such as fine-grained material retrieval and automatic captioning."

  abstract: "Authoring high-quality digital materials is key to realism in 3D rendering. Previous generative models for materials have been trained exclusively on synthetic data; such data is limited in availability and has a visual gap to real materials.  Even if carefully designed, such synthetic SVBRDFs are limited in availability, and a visual gap to real materials still exists. We circumvent this limitation by proposing PhotoMat, the first material generator trained exclusively on real photos of material samples captured using a cell phone camera with flash. Supervision on individual material maps is not available in this setting. Instead, we train a generator for a neural material representation that is rendered with a learned relighting module to create arbitrarily lit RGB images; these are compared against real photos using a discriminator. We train PhotoMat with a new dataset of 12,000 material photos captured with handheld phone cameras under flash lighting. We demonstrate that our generated materials have better visual quality than previous material generators trained on synthetic data. Moreover, we can fit analytical material models to closely match these generated neural materials, thus allowing for further editing and use in 3D rendering. "

  abstract: "Lightweight material capture methods require a material prior, defining the subspace of plausible textures within the large space of unconstrained texel grids. Previous work has either used deep neural networks (trained on large synthetic material datasets) or procedural node graphs (constructed by expert artists) as such priors. In this paper, we propose a semi-procedural differentiable material prior that represents materials as a set of (typically procedural) grayscale noises and patterns that are processed by a sequence of lightweight learnable convolutional filter operations. We demonstrate that the restricted structure of this architecture acts as an inductive bias on the space of material appearances, allowing us to optimize the weights of the convolutions per-material, with no need for pre-training on a large dataset. Combined with a differentiable rendering step and a perceptual loss, we enable single-image tileable material capture comparable with state of the art. Our approach does not target the pixel-perfect recovery of the material, but rather uses noises and patterns as input to match the target appearance. To achieve this, it does not require complex procedural graphs, and has a much lower complexity, computational cost and storage cost. We also enable control over the results, through changing the provided patterns and using guide maps to push the material properties towards a user-driven objective."

  abstract: "Recent methods (e.g. MaterialGAN) have used unconditional GANs to generate per-pixel material maps, or as a prior to reconstruct materials from input photographs. These models can generate varied random material appearance, but do not have any mechanism to constrain the generated material to a specific category or to control the coarse structure of the generated material, such as the exact brick layout on a brick wall. Furthermore, materials reconstructed from a single input photo commonly have artifacts and are generally not tileable, which limits their use in practical content creation pipelines. We propose TileGen, a generative model for SVBRDFs that is specific to a material category, always tileable, and optionally conditional on a provided input structure pattern.  TileGen is a variant of StyleGAN whose architecture is modified to always produce tileable (periodic) material maps. In addition to the standard 'style' latent code, TileGen can optionally take a condition image, giving a user direct control over the dominant spatial (and optionally color) features of the material. For example, in brick materials, the user can specify a brick layout and the brick color, or in leather materials, the locations of wrinkles and folds. Our inverse rendering approach can find a material perceptually matching a single target photograph by optimization. This reconstruction can also be conditional on a user-provided pattern. The resulting materials are tileable, can be larger than the target image, and are editable by varying the condition."

  abstract: "Graph-based procedural materials are ubiquitous in content production industries. Procedural models allow the creation of photorealistic materials with parametric control for flexible editing of appearance. However, designing a specific material is a time-consuming process in terms of building a model and fine-tuning parameters. Previous work [Hu et al. 2022; Shi et al. 2020] introduced material graph optimization frameworks for matching target material samples. However, these previous methods were limited to optimizing differentiable functions in the graphs. In this paper, we propose a fully differentiable framework which enables end-to-end gradient based optimization of material graphs, even if some functions of the graph are non-differentiable. We leverage the Differentiable Proxy, a differentiable approximator of a non-differentiable black-box function. We use our framework to match structure and appearance of an output material to a target material, through a multi-stage differentiable optimization. Differentiable Proxies offer a more general optimization solution to material appearance matching than previous work."

  abstract: "Despite the ubiquitousness of materials maps in modern rendering pipelines, their editing and control remains a challenge. In this paper, we present an example-based material control method to augment input material maps based on user-provided material photos. We train a tileable version of MaterialGAN and leverage its material prior to guide the appearance transfer, optimizing its latent space using differentiable rendering. Our method transfers the micro and meso-structure textures of user provided target(s) photographs, while preserving the structure of the input and quality of the input material. We show our methods can control existing material maps, increasing realism or generating new, visually appealing materials."

  abstract: "We present two practical approaches for high fidelity spectral upsampling of previously recorded RGB illumination in the form of an image-based representation such as an RGB light probe. Unlike previous approaches that require multiple measurements with a spectrometer or a reference color chart under a target illumination environment, our method requires no additional information for the spectral upsampling step. Instead, we construct a data-driven basis of spectral distributions for incident illumination from a set of six RGBW LEDs (three narrowband and three broadband) that we employ to represent a given RGB color using a convex combination of the six basis spectra. We propose two different approaches for estimating the weights of the convex combination using – (a) genetic algorithm, and (b) neural networks. We additionally propose a theoretical basis consisting of a set of narrow and broad Gaussians as a generalization of the approach, and also evaluate an alternate LED basis for spectral upsampling. We achieve good qualitative matches of the predicted illumination spectrum using our spectral upsampling approach to ground truth illumination spectrum while achieving near perfect matching of the RGB color of the given illumination in the vast majority of cases. We demonstrate that the spectrally upsampled RGB illumination can be employed for various applications including improved lighting reproduction as well as more accurate spectral rendering."

  abstract: "Procedural modeling is now the de facto standard of material modeling in industry. Procedural models can be edited and are easily extended, unlike pixel-based representations of captured materials. In this paper, we present a semi-automatic pipeline for general material proceduralization. Given Spatially-Varying Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Functions (SVBRDFs) represented as sets of pixel maps, our pipeline decomposes them into a tree of sub-materials whose spatial distributions are encoded by their associated mask maps. This semi-automatic decomposition of material maps progresses hierarchically, driven by our new spectrum-aware material matting and instance-based decomposition methods. Each decomposed sub-material is proceduralized by a novel multi-layer noise model to capture local variations at different scales. Spatial distributions of these sub-materials are modeled either by a by-example inverse synthesis method recovering Point Process Texture Basis Functions (PPTBF) or via random sampling. To reconstruct procedural material maps, we propose a differentiable rendering-based optimization that recomposes all generated procedures together to maximize the similarity between our procedural models and the input material pixel maps. We evaluate our pipeline on a variety of synthetic and real materials. We demonstrate our method's capacity to process a wide range of material types, eliminating the need for artist designed material graphs required in previous work. As fully procedural models, our results expand to arbitrary resolution and enable high level user control of appearance."

  abstract: "We present a novel method for efficient acquisition of shape and spatially varying reflectance of 3D objects using polarization cues. Unlike previous works that have exploited polarization to estimate material or object appearance under certain constraints (known shape or multiview acquisition), we lift such restrictions by coupling polarization imaging with deep learning to achieve high quality estimate of 3D object shape (surface normals and depth) and SVBRDF using single-view polarization imaging under frontal flash illumination. In addition to acquired polarization images, we provide our deep network with strong novel cues related to shape and reflectance, in the form of a normalized Stokes map and an estimate of diffuse color. We additionally describe modifications to network architecture and training loss which provide further qualitative improvements. We demonstrate our approach to achieve superior results compared to recent works employing deep learning in conjunction with flash illumination."

  abstract: "We present a method to transfer the appearance of one or a few exemplar SVBRDFs to a target image representing similar materials. Our solution is extremely simple: we fine-tune a deep appearance-capture network on the provided exemplars, such that it learns to extract similar SVBRDF values from the target image. We introduce two novel material capture and design workflows that demonstrate the strength of this simple approach. Our first workflow allows to produce plausible SVBRDFs of large-scale objects from only a few pictures. Specifically, users only need take a single picture of a large surface and a few close-up flash pictures of some of its details. We use existing methods to extract SVBRDF parameters from the close-ups, and our method to transfer these parameters to the entire surface, enabling the lightweight capture of surfaces several meters wide such as murals, floors and furniture. In our second workflow, we provide a powerful way for users to create large SVBRDFs from internet pictures by transferring the appearance of existing, pre-designed SVBRDFs. By selecting different exemplars, users can control the materials assigned to the target image, greatly enhancing the creative possibilities offered by deep appearance capture."

- title: "Lightweight material acquisition using deep learning"
  authors: 
    - "Valentin Deschaintre"
  abstract: "Whether it is used for entertainment or industrial design, computer graphics is ever more present in our everyday life. Yet, reproducing a real scene appearance in a virtual environment remains a challenging task, requiring long hours from trained artists. A good solution is the acquisition of geometries and materials directly from real world examples, but this often comes at the cost of complex hardware and calibration processes. In this thesis, we focus on lightweight material appearance capture to simplify and accelerate the acquisition process and solve industrial challenges such as result image resolution or calibration. Texture, highlights, and shading are some of many visual cues that allow humans to perceive material appearance in pictures. Designing algorithms able to leverage these cues to recover spatially-varying bi-directional reflectance distribution functions (SVBRDFs) from a few images has challenged computer graphics researchers for decades. We explore the use of deep learning to tackle lightweight appearance capture and make sense of these visual cues. Once trained, our networks are capable of recovering per-pixel normals, diffuse albedo, specular albedo and specular roughness from as little as one picture of a flat surface lit by the environment or a hand-held flash. We show how our method improves its prediction with the number of input pictures to reach high quality reconstructions with up to 10 images --- a sweet spot between existing single-image and complex multi-image approaches --- and allows to capture large scale, HD materials. We achieve this goal by introducing several innovations on training data acquisition and network design, bringing clear improvement over the state of the art for lightweight material capture. "

  abstract: " Empowered by deep learning, recent methods for material capture can estimate a spatially-varying reflectance from a single photograph. Such lightweight capture is in stark contrast with the tens or hundreds of pictures required by traditional optimization-based approaches. However, a single image is often simply not enough to observe the rich appearance of real-world materials. We present a deep-learning method capable of estimating material appearance from a variable number of uncalibrated and unordered pictures captured with a handheld camera and flash. Thanks to an order-independent fusing layer, this architecture extracts the most useful information from each picture, while benefiting from strong priors learned from data. The method can handle both view and light direction variation without calibration. We show how our method improves its prediction with the number of input pictures, and reaches high quality reconstructions with as little as 1 to 10 images -- a sweet spot between existing single-image and complex multi-image approaches "

  abstract: "Texture, highlights, and shading are some of many visual cues that allow humans to perceive material appearance in single pictures. Yet, recovering spatially-varying bi-directional reflectance distribution functions (SVBRDFs) from a single image based on such cues has challenged researchers in computer graphics for decades.
We tackle lightweight appearance capture by training a deep neural network to automatically extract and make sense of these visual cues. Once trained, our network is capable of recovering per-pixel normal, diffuse albedo, specular albedo and specular roughness from a single picture of a flat surface lit by a hand-held flash. We achieve this goal by introducing several innovations on training data acquisition and network design.
For training, we leverage a large dataset of artist-created, procedural SVBRDFs which we sample and render under multiple lighting directions. We further amplify the data by material mixing to cover a wide diversity of shading effects, which allows our network to work across many material classes. Motivated by the observation that distant regions of a material sample often offer complementary visual cues, we design a network that combines an encoder-decoder convolutional track for local feature extraction with a fully-connected track for global feature extraction and propagation.
Many important material effects are view-dependent, and as such ambiguous when observed in a single image. We tackle this challenge by defining the loss as a differentiable SVBRDF similarity metric that compares the renderings of the predicted maps against renderings of the ground truth from several lighting and viewing directions. Combined together, these novel ingredients bring clear improvement over state of the art methods for single-shot capture of spatially varying BRDFs."
