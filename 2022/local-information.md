## Payments
Czech Republic uses it's own currency, the Czech Krown (CZK, Kč). The exchange rate is about 1€ <=> 25 CZK, so as a quick conversion help, you can multiply by four to get the amount in Euro cents. Here is a handy conversion table:

| CZK  | Euro |
|------|------|
| 25   | 1    |
| 50   | 2    |
| 100  | 4    |
| 500  | 20   |
| 1000 | 40   |

You can pay by (credit + debit) card almost everywhere - even small amounts - except for some rare cases where they only accept cash. Beware: Euro and Dollar payments may be accepted in some touristy places, but at bad conversion rates. 

### Exchanges
Prague is littered with shady exchanges and ATMs with crazy fees (eg. blue + yellow Euronet ATMs) - especially in the city center and at the airport. Avoid these places and instead get some cash from a bank ATM (Česká spořitelna, KB, Fio, Air, Equa). Make sure to always withdraw in CZK, such that your home bank handles the conversion at your known fee & rate. Online banks like Revolut and (Transfer)Wise are transparent about their fees and will give you the exact market conversion rate.
If you must use a cash exchange, here is a list of [honest exchange places](https://honest.blog/honest-exchange-places/). [Honest guide video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_vq_YJjHoRs)

## Public Transport

Prague has a good and affordable public transport system that relies on a dense network of trams, three metro lines (<span class="label label-success">A</span>, <span class="label label-warning">B</span>, <span class="label label-danger">C</span>), buses, ferries, a funicular and local trains. All of these are included in a ticket for the duration of its validity and within the boundaries of Prague. 

### Finding connections
Finding a good connection works best with the [DPP Website](https://www.dpp.cz/en), the [official Prague transport app (PID litacka)](https://app.pidlitacka.cz/), and mostly also with Google Maps.

### Tickets
We recommend you **get the 3-day / 72 hours ticket** for 330 CZK / 13 €, which is available at every tram/metro/(bus) stop from the [yellow vending machines](https://www.dpp.cz/en/fares/list-of-points-of-sales?filter=1&ticket=1) (card payment only), the official information centers and at most little tobacco/newspaper shops (Trafika). Alternatively you can use the [official Prague transport app](https://app.pidlitacka.cz/) to buy tickets from your phone. In a pinch, short-term tickets are also available [inside the trams (card payment only)](https://www.dpp.cz/en/fares/cashless-payment-of-fare).

### From the airport to the city center
Buy an (at least) 90 minute ticket at one of the two DPP (Prague transport) information centers, or at the yellow vending machine on the bus stop. You can already use your 72hours ticket for that too. There is an Airport Express (AE) bus line to the main train station, but for an extra fee. We (and the [Honest Guide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=57WeRN0Nrb4)) recommend the following route:

<div class="alert alert-info">
Take bus 119 (every 2-5 minutes) to Nádraží Veleslavín (final stop), transfer to green Metro <span class="label label-success">A</span> in the direction Hostivař (right side when you come down) to get to the city center (Staroměstská, Můstek (connection to <span class="label label-warning">B</span>), Muzeum (connection to <span class="label label-danger">C</span>)).
</div>

### Taxis
Taxis have been famous means of scamming people in the past. It gotten way better nowadays, but you should always ask for the estimated price upfront and potentially compare to what Uber would charge you for the same route. You can safely use Uber, Bolt and similar apps in Prague.

### Bars and Restaurants
We have collected a number of recommendations for restaurants, bars and pubs in this interactive map below. There are some for the touristy city center, but most of them are further outside to give you an impression of the real Prague. We encourage you to explore the city beyond the tourist attractions - hop on a tram and make use of your ticket!
